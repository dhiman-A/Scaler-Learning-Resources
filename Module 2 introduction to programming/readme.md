This module is about the basics of python programming language. The following concepts were taught in these notebooks:

__001_Basics__ : print function print(), \n for newline character, concatenation operator

__002_data_types__: string, integers, float, boolean

__003_operators__: assignment operator(=), conditional operators(>,<,>=,<=,==,!=) logical operators(and, or, not)

__004_conditional_statements_1__: if-else statements

__005_conditional_statements_2__: nested-if statements

The function bin(number) will result in conversion of a decimal number to binary form.

The function range(a,b) will result in b-a values.

number of terms between [a,b] = b-a+1, (a,b) = b-a-1, (a,b] = b-a, [a,b) = b-a
